      <h1>C++ Programming Language</h1>
      <p>
        C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by
        Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming
        language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient
        code for large applications and software development, game development,
        and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C
        programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is
        used to develop programs for computers. This C++ Tutorial will cover all
        the basic to advanced topics of C++ like C++ basics, C++ functions, C++
        classes, OOPs and STL concepts.

      <h2>Object Oriented Programming in C++</h2>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming - As the name suggests uses objects in
        programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world
        entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.
        The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that
        operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data
        except that function. There are some basic concepts that act as the
        building blocks of OOPs i.e.<br />
        <ul class="linkable">
            <li><a id="b" href="#1">CLASS</a></li>
            <li><a id="b" href="#6">OBJECTS</a></li>
            <li><a id="b" href="#2">ENCAPSULATION </a></li>
            <li><a id="b" href="#3">ABSTRACTION</a></li>
            <li><a id="b" href="#4">POLYMORPHISM </a></li>
            <li><a id="b" href="#5">INHERITANCE</a></li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="1">Class</h3>
      <p>
        The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a
        Class. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members
        and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an
        instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. For
        Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with
        different names and brands but all of them will share some common
        properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage
        range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and
        mileage are their properties.
      </p>
      <h3 id="6">objects</h3>
      <p>
        An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and
        behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined,
        no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is
        created) memory is allocated.
      </p>
      <h3 id="2">Encapsulation</h3>
      <p>
        In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and
        information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming,
        Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions
        that manipulate them. Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in
        a company, there are different sections like the accounts section,
        finance section, sales section, etc. The finance section handles all the
        financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to
        finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related
        activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a
        situation when for some reason an official from the finance section
        needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he
        is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will
        first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then
        request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is.
        Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate
        them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

      <h3 id="3">Abstraction</h3>
      <p>
        Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of
        object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only
        essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to
        providing only essential information about the data to the outside
        world, hiding the background details or implementation. Consider a
        real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that
        pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying
        brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the
        accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the
        inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of an accelerator,
        brakes, etc. in the car
      </p>

      </div>
      <h3 id="4">Polymorphism</h3>
      <p>
        The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can
        define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more
        than one form. A person at the same time can have different
        characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an
        employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different
        situations. This is called polymorphism. An operation may exhibit
        different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon
        the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator
        overloading and function overloading.

      <h3 id="5">Inheritance</h3>
      <p>
        The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from
        another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most
        important features of Object-Oriented Programming. 
        Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class. <br>
        Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by
        a sub-class is called Base Class or Superclass. <br>
        Reusability: Inheritance
        supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new
        class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that
        we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing
        this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.
